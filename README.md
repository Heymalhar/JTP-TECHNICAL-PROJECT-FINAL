# 🎵 Dynamic Music Recommendation System

This repository hosts the official implementation of the **Dynamic Music Recommendation System**, developed as a technical deliverable for the recruitment process at **JTP Co. LTD**.

The system enables users to receive **personalized music recommendations** based on their preferences, while offering dynamic and non-repetitive outputs. Built using modern web technologies and containerized infrastructure, the project demonstrates a full-stack approach to intelligent content delivery.

## Project Description

The **Dynamic Music Recommendation System** is an end-to-end web application that allows users to:
- Register and authenticate into a personal music dashboard.
- Input **3 preferred songs** and receive **real-time recommendations**.
- View previously generated recommendations for the same combination of tracks.

The recommendation engine is designed to generate **non-repetitive**, **relevance-bound** results based on user input and contextual song features.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔐 **User Authentication** – Secure sign-up and login flow with session handling.
- 🎧 **Personalized Recommendations** – Enter 3 favorite songs and get curated suggestions.
- 🔁 **Dynamicity** – Ensures fresh, yet relevant, recommendations for repeated inputs.
- 🗂️ **History Tracking** – Stores and retrieves prior recommendations for identical song combinations.
- 🔎 **Fine-Grained Scoring** – Multi-factor scoring using similarity, artist match, and genre alignment.
- 💻 **Full Stack Architecture** – Seamless frontend-backend integration with containerized deployment.

## 🧪 Recommendation Algorithm

The recommendation engine utilizes a **modified cosine similarity** model with added intelligence for contextual filtering:

1. **Vector Storage**: All tracks in the dataset are preprocessed to compute and store normalized feature vectors.
2. **Input Aggregation**: For any 3 input tracks, the **mean normalized feature vector** is computed.
3. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Small Gaussian noise (`std = 0.015`) is added to introduce controlled randomness.
4. **Cosine Similarity**: Top 100 tracks are ranked by descending similarity score.
5. **Final Score Composition**:
   - **50%** – Cosine similarity
   - **40%** – Artist overlap (if any artist matches input artists)
   - **10%** – Genre overlap (similar to artist logic)
6. **Uniqueness Check**: A unique combination key is generated by sorting and concatenating input track IDs.
7. **Freshness Filter**: Previously recommended tracks (if any) for this combination are excluded from the final result.
8. **Result Storage**: New track recommendations are saved to the database for future retrieval.
9. **Final Output**: Top 5 similar songs are displayed to the user as the output.
